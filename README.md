# code-quiz

## Description
The inspiration for building this quiz is the educational online games like Kahoot! They are really motivating for students and a great way to cover their knowledge of a subject. This kind of quiz would also be great for high school students to set up with their own questions and test themselves. 

The problem this code-quiz attempts to solve is two-fold. Firstly, there is the need for quick revision of knowledge in order to learn and remember it. Secondly, It uses localStorage to store a highscore for the next player to beat. This creates a motivational element based on competition. 

I have learnt about the ability to transverse the DOM to make changes. This was especially important in creating and appending elements on containers that were not visible. Eventlisteners were used often in this app to carry out functions as needed.
